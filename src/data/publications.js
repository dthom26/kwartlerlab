      "Inducing hypertension in Myh11 R247C/R247C mice triggers aortic dissections with increased focal adhesion kinase signaling",

    summary:
      "Synopsis: We sought to determine if hypertension in combination with a “variant of uncertain significance” that disrupts protein function, MYH11 p.Arg247Cys, would induce aortic dissections in a mouse model. Administration of L-NAME via drinking water and a high salt diet increased blood pressure in WT and Myh11R247C/R247C mice and triggered type A dissections with cardiac tamponade in 20% of the Myh11R247C/R247C mice. Myh11R247C/R247C aortas have aberrant smooth muscle contractile unit-elastin connections by transmission electron microscopy, along with increased focal adhesion signaling at baseline, which further increases with hypertension.",

    summary:
      "Synopsis: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAD) is a life-threatening vascular disorder, and smooth muscle cell mitochondrial dysfunction leads to cell death, contributing to TAD. Accurate measurements of metabolic processes are essential for understanding cellular homeostasis in both healthy and diseased states. While assays for evaluating mitochondrial respiration have been well established for cultured cells and isolated mitochondria, no optimized application has been developed for aortic tissue. In this study, we generate an optimized protocol using the Agilent Seahorse XFe24 analyzer to measure mitochondrial respiration in mouse aortic tissue. ",

      "Immature Acta2R179C/+ smooth muscle cells cause moyamoya-like cerebrovascular lesions in mice prevented by boosting OXPHOS",

    summary:
      "Synopsis: ACTA2 pathogenic variants altering arginine 179 cause childhood-onset strokes due to moyamoya disease (MMD)-like occlusions of the distal internal carotid arteries, but the mechanisms of pathogenesis are unknown and no preventive treatments exist. Here we show that Acta2R179C/+ smooth muscle cells (SMCs) fail to fully differentiate and maintain stem cell-like features, including increased migration and glycolytic flux compared to wildtype (WT) SMCs. Increasing mitochondrial respiration with nicotinamide riboside (NR) drives differentiation and decreases migration of Acta2R179C/+ SMCs.   ",

    summary:
      "Synopsis: The implementation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models has introduced an additional tool for identifying molecular mechanisms of disease that complement animal models. Patient-derived or CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) have been leveraged to discover novel mechanisms, screen potential therapeutic strategies, and model in vivo development. The field has evolved over almost 15 years of research using hiPSC-SMCs and has made significant strides toward overcoming initial challenges such as the lineage specificity of SMC phenotypes.",
