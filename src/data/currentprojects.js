    title: "Nuclear role of skeletal muscle α-actin",
    image: "images/publications/alpha actin abcepta.jpg",
    summary:
      "Nuclear role of skeletal muscle α-actin. Pathogenic variants in ACTA1, which encodes skeletal muscle α-actin, cause a spectrum of human myopathies. At the more severe end of the disease spectrum, specific pathogenic variants cause intranuclear rod myopathy, in which skeletal muscle specific α-actin accumulates in aggregates called rods inside the cell nucleus. Although nuclear functions of skeletal muscle α-actin have not previously been established, our hypothesis is that these intranuclear rods disrupt skeletal muscle specific α-actin nuclear functions. Our work focuses on the hypothesis that, like smooth muscle α-actin, skeletal muscle α-actin is an epigenetic regulator of skeletal myocyte fate.

    title: "Epigenetic functions of smooth muscle α-actin",

    summary:
      "In addition to its well-characterized roles in the cytoskeleton, decades of research have established that ubiquitously expressed β-actin also enters the nucleus, where it performs multiple functions. Dr. Kwartler’s work as a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dianna Milewicz, M.D., Ph.D., initially showed that smooth muscle α-actin (encoded by ACTA2) has a nuclear role in smooth muscle cells that is not redundant with β-actin. Smooth muscle cells harboring pathogenic variants in ACTA2 that prevent nuclear localization of α-actin are unable to completely differentiate. Our current work utilizes both a conditional knock-in mouse model and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells for this pathogenic variant to establish the specific molecular functions of nuclear smooth muscle α-actin and which of those functions are required for the cell fate specification of smooth muscle cells.

    title: "The function of actin isoforms in INO80 complex",
    image: "images/publications/atpase.jpg",
    summary:
      "Our broad interest in epigenetic regulation of smooth muscle cell fate and our specific goal to understand how α-actins and β-actin function nonredundantly intersect in this project. We identified association between two of the moyamoya disease-associated genes (ACTA2 and YY1AP1) and the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. We therefore began to investigate whether the INO80 complex might be important in smooth muscle cells – this work was funded by an American Heart Association Career Development Award which ended in 2024. We developed a model system to purify human INO80 complexes containing a specific actin from 293T cells and are using this system to characterize the effects of different actin isoform integration on the biochemical function of the INO80 complex.",

    title:
      "Dysregulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation in moyamoya disease",
    image: "images/publications/Moyamoya_disease-MRI_T1.png",
    summary:
      "We collaborate with the laboratory of Dianna Milewicz, M.D., Ph.D, also at UTHealth. Her group has studied the genetic basis of moyamoya disease and identified seven novel genes that predispose to the disease. Critically, many of these genes encode proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. Additionally, the ACTA2 pathogenic variant that disrupts smooth muscle cell differentiation also causes a moyamoya-like cerebrovascular phenotype. Therefore, our lab hypothesizes that incomplete smooth muscle cell differentiation as a result of aberrant chromatin remodeling underlies moyamoya disease pathogenesis. We use induced pluripotent stem cell models with moyamoya-associated pathogenic variants to assess whether smooth muscle cell differentiation is impaired and the specific molecular pathways that are disrupted. This project is funded by an R03 award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.",
